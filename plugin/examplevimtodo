VimTodo
=======

Pressing the t key in normal mode
inserts a new todo item

Pressing the space bar in normal
mode anywhere in a todo item will
toggle the check box

Pressing the q key in normal mode
will save and quit

I also recommend a markdown
syntax highlighter as this is now
a markdown file

[ ] unchecked box
[x] checked box
